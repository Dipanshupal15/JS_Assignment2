Que 1- What are the differences between var, let and const ?
Ans 1- var was traditionally used for variable declaration in JavaScript but has function scope and can be redeclared.
      `let` and `const` were introduced in ES6. `let` has block scope and allows reassignment, while `const` also has block scope 
       but its value cannot be   reassigned once set (immutable).

Que 2- Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN.
Ans 2- "Undefined" is a special value representing the absence of a value or the default value of uninitialized variables.
       "Not defined" refers to situations where a variable or identifier has not been declared or is not in scope.
       "NaN" is a special value representing "Not a Number," often the result of operations that don't yield a meaningful numeric value.

Que 3- What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what ?
Ans 3- Undefined: (Default value)
       - Variables that are declared but not initialized are automatically assigned the value undefined.
       - Function parameters that are not provided with a value default to undefined.
       
       Use undefined:
       - When a variable is declared but not assigned a value.
       - As a default value for function parameters.
       - When accessing properties of objects that do not exist.
       - As the default return value of functions that do not explicitly return anything.

       Null: (Developer-Assigned Value)
       - null is a value that can be explicitly assigned by a developer to indicate the intentional absence of any object value.

       Use null:
       - When you want to explicitly indicate that a variable, property, or object has no meaningful value.
       - It can be used as a placeholder for an object that may be assigned later.

Que 4- What is execution context ?
Ans 4- In JavaScript, the term "execution context" refers to the environment in which JavaScript code is executed and evaluated.
       It consists of various components that define the context for the code being run, including variable scope, the value of 
       'this', and the scope chain. 

Que 5- What is use of prompt in JavaScript ? 
Ans 5- The prompt function in JavaScript is used to interact with the user by displaying a dialog box that prompts them to enter 
       some input. It's commonly used in web development to get data or information from users through a simple text input field in a pop-up window.

Que 6- Why JavaScript is Dyanmic Language ?
Ans 6- JavaScript is often referred to as a dynamic language due to its flexibility and dynamic nature, allowing developers to perform
       a variety of operations at runtime that are not possible or are more constrained in statically-typed languages.
